## findRecursively
- finds a node in abinary tree

## dfsPreOrder
- goes through each node in a binary search tree using pre-order depth first search and return an array containing each node's value

## dfsInOrder
- search through each node in the binary search tree using in-order depth first search and return an array containing each node's value

## dfsPostOrder
- should search through each node in the binary search tree using post-order depth first search and return an array containing each node's value
